            <h1 class="card-title p-2" style="text-align: center;">Why Do I think AR become popular in the future?</h1>
            <div class="card-body">
              <p>AR has gained immense popularity in recent years, and I believe it will continue to flourish in the future. The familiarity of AR among the generation that grew up with social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat has played a significant role in its widespread adoption. The introduction of face filters on Snapchat, allowing users to add fun augmented reality elements like dog ears and noses, sparked a revolution in social media. AR filters have become more than just amusing animations; they have become a means for individuals to express themselves and shape their desired image.</p>

              <p>Beyond face filters, we have witnessed the phenomenal success of Pokémon Go in 2016, a game that seamlessly blended real and virtual worlds. This groundbreaking application provided people with a glimpse into the vast possibilities of augmented reality. AR has evolved from a mere pastime of catching imaginary creatures to a practical tool with various applications. For instance, Apple's introduction of the LiDAR sensor enabled accurate mapping of environments, enabling users to measure room dimensions and enhance AR experiences by placing virtual objects in physical spaces. This capability allows people to visualize how a piece of furniture would fit in a room before making a purchase online.</p>

              <p>The recent announcement of Meta further reinforces the potential of AR. Meta envisions expanding the virtual world, providing an interactive platform where creativity and imagination can thrive. One fascinating concept showcased was the ability to scan a QR code next to an artwork, such as a mural, and experience it as a captivating 3D animated creation through augmented reality. To extend this experience, customers would have the opportunity to support the artist by providing a tip. This example merely scratches the surface of the possibilities that AR can offer. The scope for stretching and molding AR technology is immense.</p>

              <p>While there are concerns about the potential drawbacks of an increasingly virtual world, I believe AR can be harnessed responsibly to enhance human experiences. It is crucial to strike a balance and ensure that individuals do not lose sight of the line between the real and virtual realms. When utilized respectfully, AR has the power to revolutionize various industries and provide innovative solutions. The future of augmented reality holds great promise, and I am excited to witness its continued growth and positive impact.</p>

                <p>Italy holds a special place in my heart as it marks the first international journey my family and I embarked upon during my time in Middle School. This remarkable country provided us with an opportunity to delve into the unfamiliar, immersing ourselves in its rich culture, delectable cuisine, and captivating people. Witnessing my parents navigate through a foreign land alongside me, I realized we were all equally unaccustomed to this novel experience, making our adventure all the more thrilling. In preparation for our trip, we eagerly absorbed travel knowledge from various sources, such as travel channels, which equipped us with essential skills like asking for directions to nearby restaurants or rest stops.</p>

                <p>Within this AR project, I aim to encapsulate the memories forged during my time in Pisa. On the Merge Cube, I proudly present meticulously crafted models representing iconic symbols of this enchanting city. The first, the renowned Leaning Tower of Pisa, stands tall, embodying the awe-inspiring architecture that defines the region. Accompanying it is a vibrant model of a Vespa, an emblem of Italian transportation and style. Lastly, paying homage to Italy's culinary prowess, I exhibit a delectable depiction of its greatest contribution to the world: pizza! I am indebted to the talented online artists who have provided these remarkable models, and their contributions are duly credited below. Additionally, utilizing the powerful Unity Game Engine, I have personally designed two additional models: a charming table and the beloved Italian flag.</p>

                <p>To enhance the immersive experience further, the sides of the cube display essential information about the location, Pisa, Italy, ensuring that viewers are fully immersed in the setting. Furthermore, real-time data, including the current time in both AM and PM formats and the local weather in Fahrenheit, is fetched using the reliable APIs offered by <a href="http://worldtimeapi.org">worldtimeapi.org</a> and <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">openweathermap.org</a>, respectively. Lastly, I proudly incorporate the emblematic logo of the illustrious Ferrari Automobile Company, an iconic symbol synonymous with Italian craftsmanship and automotive excellence.</p>

                <p>This AR project serves as a nostalgic tribute to the treasured memories created in Italy and encapsulates the essence of my journey through Pisa, capturing the sights, flavors, and cultural nuances that touched my soul.</p>

            <p>The models displayed on the class cube are meant to represent London, England. Coming from India, where cricket holds immense significance, this sport has played a central role in the lives of many people I know. It is a cherished pastime enjoyed and celebrated throughout the country, with India being the proud host of the world's biggest cricket Premier League, known as IPL. Although cricket is deeply ingrained in Indian culture, it was introduced to the Indians during the British colonization of the Indian subcontinent.</p>

            <p>I had the incredible opportunity to visit Lord's Cricket Stadium, the historic ground where India secured victory in the ICC World Cup in 1983. This momentous event holds great importance for cricket enthusiasts, as it marked India's first-ever win in the One-Day International World Cup. Despite technical difficulties preventing the match from being televised in India, people eagerly tuned in through the radio, rejoicing with immense pride upon the live announcement of the results. The displayed model represents a cricket pitch, serving as a nostalgic reminder of that remarkable achievement. Additionally, to symbolize the British region, I have included a classic phone booth commonly seen on the streets of London and an elegant tea cup. Tea, known for its significance in both Indian and British cultures, reflects the shared love for this delightful beverage.</p>
