<p>Italy holds a special place in my heart as it marks the first international journey my family and I embarked upon during my time in Middle School. This remarkable country provided us with an opportunity to delve into the unfamiliar, immersing ourselves in its rich culture, delectable cuisine, and captivating people. Witnessing my parents navigate through a foreign land alongside me, I realized we were all equally unaccustomed to this novel experience, making our adventure all the more thrilling. In preparation for our trip, we eagerly absorbed travel knowledge from various sources, such as travel channels, which equipped us with essential skills like asking for directions to nearby restaurants or rest stops.</p>

<p>Within this AR project, I aim to encapsulate the memories forged during my time in Pisa. On the Merge Cube, I proudly present meticulously crafted models representing iconic symbols of this enchanting city. The first, the renowned Leaning Tower of Pisa, stands tall, embodying the awe-inspiring architecture that defines the region. Accompanying it is a vibrant model of a Vespa, an emblem of Italian transportation and style. Lastly, paying homage to Italy's culinary prowess, I exhibit a delectable depiction of its greatest contribution to the world: pizza! I am indebted to the talented online artists who have provided these remarkable models, and their contributions are duly credited below. Additionally, utilizing the powerful Unity Game Engine, I have personally designed two additional models: a charming table and the beloved Italian flag.</p>

<p>To enhance the immersive experience further, the sides of the cube display essential information about the location, Pisa, Italy, ensuring that viewers are fully immersed in the setting. Furthermore, real-time data, including the current time in both AM and PM formats and the local weather in Fahrenheit, is fetched using the reliable APIs offered by <a href="http://worldtimeapi.org">worldtimeapi.org</a> and <a href="https://openweathermap.org/">openweathermap.org</a>, respectively. Lastly, I proudly incorporate the emblematic logo of the illustrious Ferrari Automobile Company, an iconic symbol synonymous with Italian craftsmanship and automotive excellence.</p>

<p>This AR project serves as a nostalgic tribute to the treasured memories created in Italy and encapsulates the essence of my journey through Pisa, capturing the sights, flavors, and cultural nuances that touched my soul.</p>
