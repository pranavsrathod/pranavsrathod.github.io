<p><strong>CS 428 : Fall 2022</strong></p>
<p><strong>Project 1</strong></p>

<p>This project is to showcase two places/attractions that have been significant in my life and have been admired the most, to be displayed on physical cubes, through the magic of Augmented Reality (AR).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The two attractions that I have chosen are:</p>
<p>-   	The Leaning Tower of Pisa – Pisa, Italy</p>
<p>-   	Lords Cricket Stadium – London, United Kingdom</p>
<p> </p>
<p>They Look something Like this:</p>
<p><img src="Image_0.jpg" /></p>
<p>This was achieved by using Unity and leveraging the Vuforia Package, which allowed me to implement this in Augmented Reality.</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Models Shown on the Two Cubes:</strong></p>

<p>Italy is a country that is very special to me. It was the first country that me and my family visited when I was in Middle School. None of my family members had ever traveled outside our home country before and it was the first time we got to explore an unfamiliar place, to get to experience their culture, food and the people. It was interesting to see how my parents navigated a foreign country, because they were as new to being in a new place as I was with the same scarcity of intel. Before visiting we prepared by watching travel channels and learning how to ask directions to the nearest restaurant or a rest stop.</p>

<p>The Models Shown on the Merge Cube are a representation of the time I spent in Pisa, the things I got to see, eat, and the vehicle we got to ride.</p>

<p>I have displayed the leaning tower of Pisa, a Vespa (italian scooter), and the best creation that Italy has shared with the world, a PIZZA! These models are sourced from artists online and are cited below. I have also made two separate models using the Unity Game Engine which are the Table and the Italian Flag</p>

<p>The Sides of the Cube Showcase the Location (Pisa, Italy), The Current Time (in AM/PM) and Weather in *F that is fetched using <u><a href="http://worldtimeapi.org" rel="nofollow">http://worldtimeapi.org</a></u> and <u><a href="https://openweathermap.org/" rel="nofollow">https://openweathermap.org/</a></u> respectively as well as the Logo of the Ferrari Automobile Company.</p>

<p>If the flip the cube the directional light would change from red to blue, and change back to red when flipped again.</p>
<p>The Models displayed on the class cube are meant to represent London, England. Being from India, people that I grew up around took cricket very seriously, it is a sport that is dear to a lot of people I know and enjoys being watched and played throughout the country. India also hosts the world’s biggest Cricket Premier League known as IPL. Even though Cricket is the biggest sport in India, It was not invented there, It was introduced to the Indians during the British Colonization of the Indian subcontinent. </p>

<p>I got a chance to visit the Lords Cricket Stadium where India won the ICC World Cup in the year 1983, which made it a historic ground for the cricket lovers and was the first One-Day International World Cup that India won. The match, due to technical difficulties, was not televised in India, but people tuned in using the Radio and celebrated with pride after the results were announced live. The Model that is Displayed is supposed to represent a cricket pitch, and to associate that to the british region, I have also added a phone booth that is commonly seen around the streets of London and a fancy tea cup, another thing that the Indians and the Brits seem to have in common is their love for tea.</p>

<p>The models that were made by me are the Cricket stumps and the Season Ball (the season ball’s texture was made by me using procreate).</p>

<p>The Sides of the cube showcase the Time in London (in military format), The weather and temperature in *C, The Location (Lords Stadium, London) as well as the Logo of the World Cup tournament. </p>
<p>On Flipping the cube upside down it should shine a blue spot light on one of the stumps and turns off when flipped back.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Started with Setting up the Environment</strong></p>

<p><strong>Unity:</strong></p>
<p>To Download Unity3D go to <u><a href="https://unity.com/" rel="nofollow">https://unity.com/</a></u> → Get Started → Choose the Individual Tab → Personal → Get started. This should download Unity Hub for the Operating System you are using.</p>

<p>After Unity Hub has been installed, this becomes a central “hub” of all the various projects. </p>

<p>To add a Unity Version:</p>
<p>Click on <strong>Installs → Install Editor</strong> to add a new Unity Version.</p>
<p>The version I have worked on in this project is the version <strong>2021.3.6f1</strong>, which you can find by clicking on the ‘<strong>Archive</strong>’ button (next to the ‘Long-Term Support’ Text) which will take you to a webpage. Look for the <strong>LTS Release 2021.3.6f1 → Unity Hub</strong> , This would let Unity Hub download and install the version.</p>


<p>You must install: </p>
<ul><li>Unity</li></ul>
<li>Documentation</li>
<li>Android Build Support (for running it on your android smartphone)</li>
<ul><li>Click on the little arrow and make sure that Android SDK & NDK Tools and OpenJDK are both selected.</li></ul>
<li>iOS Build Support (if you want to deploy your application on an iPhone)</li>
<li>Visual Studio Code (VSCode) if you are comfortable with VSCode else Unity will launch a variety of external code editors for working with code (You will be editing C# Code in this project.</li></ul>

<p>Keep in mind that you will need <strong>Unity to be installed in your computer’s root/admin directory</strong> (or else Unity hub will download the files and fail on the installation). You can change the location by clicking the gear on the left pane of Unity Hub → Installs → Change the install location to your home directory.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>Downloading and Opening the project in Unity: </strong></p>

<p>Go to <u><a href="https://github.com/pranavsrathod/pratho2CS428Project1" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/pranavsrathod/pratho2CS428Project1</a></u></p>
<ol><li>Click on the Green Code Button</li>
<li>Click on Download Zip - this would download a compressed zip file of the project</li></ol>
<p><img src="cid:Image_9.png" /></p>

<ul><li>Create a new 3D project in Unity Hub using the Projects tab on the left and then a new project of type 3D core.</li></ul>
<li>Unzip my project and go to Assets/Scenes and there you will find a RoswellScene, drag that into your hierarchy and remove the default untitled scene.</li>
<li>After this, the two cube with the models must appear on the screen Which should look like this:</li></ul>

<p><img src="cid:Image_10.png" /></p>


<p><strong>Adding The Vuforia Package :</strong><strong> </strong></p>

<p>You will need to make a free developer account on the Vuforia web page - <u><a href="https://developer.vuforia.com/" rel="nofollow">https://developer.vuforia.com/</a></u></p>

<p>Select Vuforia 10.9 from <u><a href="https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk" rel="nofollow">https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk</a></u> Then click on 'Add Vuforia Engine to a Unity Project or upgrade to the latest version'. Vuforia should download as add-vuforia-package-10-9-3.unitypackage.</p>

<p>To add the Vuforia Engine to your Unity project :</p>
<p>On the Menu bar :</p>
<ul><li>Assets → Import Package → Custom Package</li></ul>
<li>Select the Uncompressed Vuforia Engine Folder and click Import and give the Permission to update.</li>
<li>If using MacOS and do not have command line tools installed the system will give you a warning. Install the Command Line Tools by going to the terminal and running the command “xcode-select --install”.</li>
<li>In the Unity Scene hierarchy, delete the main camera as the Vuforia package will add its own camera.</li>
<li>Go to your Vuforia Account and create a free Vuforia App License Key that will be needed to remove the watermark when the application is running.</li>
<li>Copy the License Key and go to the Unity project’s menu bar, select : Window → Vuforia Configuration, and in the inspector window on the left, near the top in the global section add your copied App License key.</li>
<li>Save and your steps to add the vuforia package are complete.</li></ul>
<p></p>

<p><strong>Making The Physical Cubes: </strong></p>

<p>After all those exhausting steps, Let us Do some arts and crafts:</p>
<p>We need to make Physical Cubes, Let Us Name them the Merge Cube and the Class Cube.</p>
<p>Here is the link to the <u>zip file</u> for You to download, print, cut and build the two cubes.</p>

<p>I Suggest cutting accurately and using school glue instead of tape because you need the cube to be visible to the camera and not reflect anything to be tracked properly.</p>

<p><img src="cid:Image_11.jpg" /></p>
<p>Left - Merge Cube</p>
<p>Right - Class Cube</p>
<p></p>


<p></p>
<p><strong>Running The Application on an Android Phone</strong></p>

<p>In Unity go to Edit / Project Settings / Player / Other Settings and select Minimum API Level to Android 8.0 Kitkat (API level 26)</p>
<p><img src="cid:Image_12.png" /></p>

<p>Connect your android phone to the computer with the appropriate cable. On the phone go to Settings, select Developer options, and then enable USB debugging. If you don't see developer options, go to Settings > About Phone > Build Number and tap the "Build Number" option 7 times to enable developer options. Once developer options are enabled, turn on USB debugging.</p>

<p>On the Unity project’s menu bar Go to Window → Vuforia Configuration. On the inspector window, scroll down to Device Tracker settings and make sure that the ‘Include ARCore Library’ is Unchecked</p>
<p><img src="cid:Image_13.png" /></p>

<p>In Unity go to  File / Build Settings and hit Refresh' next to Run Device. You should now see the connected mobile phone in the dropdown menu. Select the phone and hit Build and Run. If you are prompted to save the apk, save it on your computer. The project will build and run automatically on your phone.</p>
