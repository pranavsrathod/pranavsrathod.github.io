        <p>To use this app you must have Unity 2021.3.6f1 (go here https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive and find the version and download via unity hub) and VRTK version 4 (it is already included in the files so no need to worry about installing this) and download the app files from the git repository </p>
        <p> Link To The Project : <u><a href="Project Link" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/pranavsrathod/OurHouse</a></u></p>
        <p>After extracting the zip file, open the file in unity and go into assets/CoffeeShopStarterPack/Scenes and open up the CoffeeShop Scene. From here you can see all the files that we used and you can begin using the app in the editor. The scene is of a comic/game kiosk in the new CS building that’s selling various game and comic related items.</p>
        <p>To be able to run the app, make sure you have CameraRigs.UnityXRPluginFramework disabled and you have CameraRigs.SpatialSimulator enabled. Once the scene builds, use WASD to move around and the mouse to look around. You can also use 2 and 3 to take control of the left and right controllers respectively and move them around with WASD and the mouse. You can grab and interact with various objects in the scene as well. To run the app in VR, first you need to have CameraRigs.UnityXRPluginFramework enabled and CameraRigs.SpatialSimulator disabled.</p>
        <p>Then connect your oculus headset and under Unity Build Settings make sure you are building for the Android Platform and the particular Quest you connected should show up under the Run Device list of compatible connected devices. If the Quest headset does not show up in the list you may need to unplug and re-plug the USB cable and again tell the quest to accept the connection to the laptop. You may also need to make sure USB debugging is enabled on the quest. </p>
        <p>You can check this by clicking on the Quick Settings menu on the left side of the thin menu, then clicking on the settings menu on the upper right, then scrolling down in the menu on the left to Developer and turning on the USB Connection Dialog. After clicking build and run, wait for the app to build and it should start automatically on the quest. From there you can experience the scene in VR either via walking around the scene or teleporting around, being able to interact with the same objects as you could when running the scene in the editor with the oculus touch controllers. </p>

                <p>Viewing and interacting with the kiosk in VR is vastly different than when you are doing the same thing via the Unity simulator. In the simulator it is similar to playing a normal pc game where you can use WASD to move around the world. It then becomes very different as you have to use the 2 and 3 keys to switch between the player and the oculus controllers. After switching to them you can use the same controls to move the controllers around the scene and rotate them with the mouse. By clicking the left mouse button you can grab objects that are interesting with your controller. It is kind of jarring to play in the simulator as it becomes difficult at times to move the controllers into the right spot to interact with certain items in the scene. </p>
                <p>The experience in VR is a lot smoother and easier to interact with the scene. The first main difference is that you can teleport around the scene as well as walk around the space by walking in the real world. It is also much easier to interact with the various items in the scene because you can just move your hand to that location and not have to deal with trying to have the controller point in the right direction with your mouse and then move it with the WASD keys. Playing in VR also gives you a sense of scale with the scene. You can easily see the different sizes of the items in comparison to your own height which is something that cannot be replicated via the simulator. It also gives you a sense of spatial awareness as well as you can see everything around you as if you were actually there. The 3D sounds help this too since you can physically get closer to the objects playing these sounds and hear them get louder as you do. This is something you can experience in the simulator as well but I personally think it has a bigger impact on your spatial awareness in the VR headset rather than in the editor. Playing the scene in VR lets you experience the physics of the objects much better than in the simulator. While the simulator lets you pick up objects, move them around, and bump them into other objects it doesn’t give you a full sense of the physics. Whereas when you are in VR you can do all of the things in the simulator as well as toss things around among other things that will display the physics much more than you can fully simulate with the controllers in the simulator.
                </p>
                <p>Because of all of these reasons I believe that being able to view our project in VR makes it a much better experience overall than just being able to view it in the simulator. While the simulator does a good job of mimicking the VR headset and the controllers it is best for testing out the scene. The full experience should be saved for the VR headset as it will give you the best feel of the scene that you have created.

                <!-- <h2>Pranav Rathod :</h2> -->
                <p>I remember when I used to pick up the morning news paper I used to see all these front page cover advertisements of new property launches and deals/offers that came if you decided to invest in the property as soon as possible, I was so fascinated by how fantastical it seemed to see a mock rendering, of how the building, the part and the clubhouse would like way before it was built and imagine my life there. Everything that was built seemed so futuristic when seen as a mock up image and a few years later I would walk by the same building that was advertised and be reminded of the first time I saw it in the newspaper.
                </p>
                <p>With the power of virtual reality people have gotten a more immersive experience to picture themselves in a space, I think when a person looks at a 2 Dimensional Image of a building it is hard to imagine the scale at which the objects are meant to be. In other words, things seen in images may trick people into thinking that the place is larger than it actually is. Leveraging Virtual Reality helps people understand the space better than looking at plane images or even a miniature 3D Figure. </p>
                <p>I gained a lot of insight into sizes and scales with respect to the human eye. For example objects were fairly scaled up when I was placing them in the scene but in VR mode, they were either too small or too large. Being able to see things in Virtual Reality I was able to map things out the way I wanted it to be. This would be much harder to plan out on a piece of paper. </p>
                <p>When an Interior Designer or an Architect starts off modeling the way they want something they have to keep track of measurements of the size of the room and map things out respectively, this involves math in terms of how much space would some object occupy with also considering if it may be obstructing something. Having VR helps ease this task when it comes to the complexity of people who may find it difficult to picture things spatially.
                </p>
                <p>The new CS building by UIC for example is an excellent example of getting people excited about things offered at UIC especially the computer science, Not only is the new Computer Science building a strong point to attract new coming people to UIC but also the VR, being made by the UIC CS and EVL is a strong notice to people to be interested in the courses being offered.</p>
