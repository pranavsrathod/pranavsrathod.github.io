            <p class="lead">Hello there! I'm Pranav Rathod, an aspiring software engineer with a passion for exploring the latest advancements in technology. I'm currently pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science with a specialization in Multimedia and Creative Technologies at the University of Southern California (USC). My areas of focus include UI/UX design, AR/VR, mobile application development, data science, artificial intelligence, and computer graphics.</p>
            <p class="lead">In addition to my technical pursuits, I have a strong passion for photography and have pursued a minor in art during my undergraduate studies. I believe that these two fields are closely related, and my understanding of aesthetics and design principles enhances my ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly software applications.</p>
            <p class="lead">Currently, I'm working as a Media Support Specialist at USC, which has given me valuable experience in handling media technologies and supporting creative projects. I've also worked as a teaching assistant for a framework-based development class, where I guided students in learning the Flutter SDK and developing their own mobile applications. Additionally, I have experience as a research assistant working on an NUI-based project, which has allowed me to delve into cutting-edge technology and collaborate with a team of experts.</p>
            <p class="lead">I'm excited about the future of technology and the possibilities it holds. As I continue to grow and learn as a software engineer, I'm committed to developing innovative and impactful software solutions that can make a difference in people's lives. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my work, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!</p>
