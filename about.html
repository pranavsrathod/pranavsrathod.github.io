            <p class="lead">Hello there! My name is Pranav Rathod and I am an aspiring software engineer with a passion for exploring the latest advancements in technology. I am currently pursuing a degree in computer science, with a focus on topics such as UI/UX design, AR/VR, mobile application development, data science, artificial intelligence, and computer graphics.</p>
            <p class="lead">In addition to my technical interests, I also have a passion for photography and have pursued a minor in art. I believe that these two fields are closely related and that my understanding of aesthetics and design principles can help me create visually appealing and user-friendly software applications.</p>
            <p class="lead">I am currently working as a research assistant on an NUI-based project, which has given me valuable experience in working on cutting-edge technology and collaborating with a team of experts. I have also worked as a teaching assistant for a framework-based development class, where I helped students learn Flutter SDK and develop their own mobile applications.</p>
            <p class="lead">I am excited about the future of technology and the possibilities that it holds. I am constantly learning and growing as a software engineer and am committed to creating innovative and impactful software solutions that can make a difference in people's lives. Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me and my work, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!</p>
