            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <h3>Most people who are familiar with the Marvel Studios’ movies popularly known as the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) know that Iron Man (Tony Stark) plays a crucial role in the vast 22-movie “Infinity Saga”. Iron Man is the first Superhero that was introduced in this movie series and has been the leading superhero that has looked after, driven his peers and other superheroes being a “genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist”.</h3>

                Marvel’s Iron Man VR is a virtual reality game that was introduced initially on the PlayStation VR in the year 2020 that allowed users to step into the shoes of the well renowned superhero not literally but virtually, and play around fighting an army of bots and completing missions. The game gives the user a chance to see what it would look like from a first person perspective being in the Iron Man suit, and fly around using the two controllers.

            <h1>Is this Game a Good Use of VR?</h1> 
            <h3>
                I think that the game is an amazing use of the concept of virtual reality since it allows the user to simulate something that cannot be actually performed in the real world, or at-least something that is not going to be implemented or physically available to try in the near future. Even if it were something that a person could physically try out it would be something expensive, dangerous and won’t allow them to fire or fight with an army of robots. Thus having this game in VR reality can provide for people to get fictional experiences of flying at high altitudes in the comfort of their homes.
            </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>
                The concept is a great way for players to mimic the way iron man flies around as shown in the comics, movies and animated series. For example the way people fly in the game changes according to the position of the two VR controllers which are supposed to act like the “Repulsors” that act as Iron Man’s tools for fight and flight. 
            </h3>
            <img class="center" src="SChoice/repulsors.jpeg" alt="IRON MAN VR POSTER" ;="" >
            <h3>
                When the VR headset is put on, we see everything like the way Tony Stark sees when he puts on the helmet with data like the information of the state of the suit, the person who is calling and the information that Stark’s personal AI Assistant “F.R.I.D.A.Y” is trying to show the player in the form of Holographic complications.
            </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>
                If this game were to be run on a normal gaming console using DualShock or an Xbox Controller, it would not be as immersive as it would be in a Virtual Reality environment. With the power of virtual reality, people are able to interact with objects and play as if they are being placed physically inside the scene, move around Tony Stark’s mansion and have a feeling as if the players themselves are Tony Stark.
            </h3>
            <br>
            <h3>
                Even though games like Call of Duty, Halo are played in a first person perspective where the player is supposed to be playing from the character’s perspective, they are not immersive because the player is expected to play from the limitations of a 2-Dimensional Screen and not an immersive Virtual Reality experience. In other words Iron Man VR is unlike other games that forces a player to understand a character’s perspective instead it allows the player to be the character, immerse themselves in the fantasy of being a superhero which is not confined to the limitations of a Dual-Shock (or any other) controller.
