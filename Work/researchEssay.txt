As an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the ELICIT Lab, located at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I was actively involved in a project focused on understanding multimodal user interactions to train machine learning models. This experience provided me with valuable insights into the field of human-computer interaction and the application of advanced technologies.

One of my key contributions to the project was the development of a custom application using Flutter. This application was designed to log users’ speech and gesture interactions and establish correlations between them. By creating this application, I was able to effectively capture and analyze data that contributed to our research objectives.

Additionally, I was responsible for conducting user studies as part of our data collection process. These studies involved engaging with participants to gather a diverse range of data related to their interactions. Through carefully designed experiments and observation techniques, I collected valuable insights and generated meaningful findings.

To enhance the accuracy of our data analysis, I leveraged the power of Google Cloud Platform’s Speech-to-Text service. Utilizing this service enabled us to achieve reliable speech recognition and generate accurate timestamps, which further contributed to the overall success of our research.

Overall, my experience as an Undergraduate Research Assistant allowed me to actively contribute to a project aimed at advancing our understanding of multimodal user interactions. Through the development of an application, conducting user studies, and leveraging advanced technologies, I gained practical skills in data collection, analysis, and research methodologies.
