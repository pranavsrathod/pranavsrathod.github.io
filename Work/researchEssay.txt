As an Undergraduate Research Assistant at the iMIX Lab, located at the University of Illinois at Chicago, I have been actively involved in a project focused on understanding multimodal user interactions to train machine learning models. This experience has provided me with valuable insights into the field of human-computer interaction and the application of advanced technologies.

One of my key contributions to the project was the development of a custom application using Flutter. This application was designed to log user's speech and gesture interactions and establish correlations between them. By creating this application, I was able to effectively capture and analyze data that would contribute to our research objectives.

Additionally, I have been responsible for conducting user studies as part of our data collection process. These studies involve engaging with participants to gather a diverse range of data related to their interactions. Through carefully designed experiments and observation techniques, I have been able to collect valuable insights and generate meaningful findings.

In order to enhance the accuracy of our data analysis, I have leveraged the power of Google Cloud Platform's Speech-to-Text service. By utilizing this service, we have been able to achieve reliable speech recognition and generate accurate timestamps, which further contribute to the overall success of our research.

Overall, my experience as an Undergraduate Research Assistant has allowed me to actively contribute to a project aimed at advancing our understanding of multimodal user interactions. Through the development of an application, conducting user studies, and leveraging advanced technologies, I have gained practical skills in data collection, analysis, and research methodologies.
