I was awarded 3rd place in the Engineering and Physical Science Category for my presentation on "Designing Speech and Gesture interactions for Image Editing Mobile Applications" at the University of Illinois at Chicago's Undergraduate Research Forum on Tuesday, April 18, 2023.

As the sole Research Assistant and lead for this project at the ELICIT Lab at UIC, I have been dedicated to developing mobile applications, conducting pilot studies, and user studies to enhance user experiences in the development of Multimodal Image Editing Applications.

It was a great experience to take part in the Undergraduate Research Forum and be inspired by the undergraduate research community. I am grateful for the opportunity to showcase my work and contribute to the field of engineering and physical sciences.

I want to express my gratitude to my research supervisor, Dr. Nikita Soni, PHD, for her guidance and support throughout this project. Her expertise and mentorship have been invaluable to my success.

I am honored to receive this recognition for my hard work and commitment to improving the field of multimodal interfaces. I could not have achieved this without the support of my research advisor.
